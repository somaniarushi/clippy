 Recreating the Clipboard.
 
It all started with a simple question: how do clipboards work? A quick google revealed that, conceptually, clipboards were not super complicated â€“â€“ nothing more than temporary spaces in memory.
 
Which lead to the question â€“â€“ what would it take to make a clipboard? Not much, as you can see. No more than an HTML file, in fact.

Written in: pure HTML, CSS, JS.
